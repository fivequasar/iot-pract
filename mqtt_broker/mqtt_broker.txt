apt-get update

apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y 

cd /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/

echo 4640D_user:4640D_password > password

mosquitto_passwd -U password

cat password

#Note please create this in conf.d folder (Either VIM or touch the file UP TO YOU)
vim default.conf (from line 15 to 27 paste the command into the default.conf file)

listener 1883

allow_anonymous false

password_file password

systemctl restart mosquitto.service (error is expected for some reason....)

mosquitto -v -c default.conf 

IF YOU CANNOT RUN THE CONF, IT CAN BE DEBUGGED IN DIFFERENT WAYS:

1) Kill the process
ps -ef | grep mosquitto
sudo kill <PID>

2) restart the service (error is to be expected)
systemctl restart mosquitto.service
